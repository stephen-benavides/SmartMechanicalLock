**The cost as of today is of $8
 
*This board has a 3.3v regulator 
*We can use the arduino IDE with the ESP32 and the python environment 
*The power consumption is the same as the ESP8266
*The software is still in development for the ESP32, we might have a bit of troubles getting support from the community because is in the early stages
*Overall the ESP32 can replace both the ESP8266 and the ARDUINO UNO depending on the task 
*Python 2.7
*For test purposes we can use a power bank and can be used as a representation for the batteries in the project 

NOTES:
*Flash memory retains data in the absence of a power supply, is slower than RAM but faster than HDD; Thus we can store instant information into the chip
up to 16MB of data.
